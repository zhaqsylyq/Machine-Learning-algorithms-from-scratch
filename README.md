Machine Learning

Implemented Nearest Centroid Classifier and Perceptron algorithms from scratch based on their underlying linear algebra logic
• Trained both of the models on USPS dataset
• Accuracy on the test set for both of the models was about 90%
• Technical Skills: Python, Pylab, NumPy, SciPy, pdb, Linear Algebra.
